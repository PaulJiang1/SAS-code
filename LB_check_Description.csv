22,Error,"For discrete tests, check if the LBORRES is in Appendix 2 and ensure that the correct standardized representation is presented in LBSTRESC","The Lab Data Handling and Derivations document appendix 2 is an Excel spreadsheet that maps discrete LBORRES values to a standardized representation in LBSTRESC. The requirement to standardize LBSTRESC is required by the SDTM implementation guide and a limited amount of controlled terminology has been published by CDISC. A copy of the approved mappings from appendix 2 and new mapping which have since been added, are located in the last tab of this spreadsheet. There are still many way to discretely report test results for which no mapping is present, these include numeric discrete result (eg from a disptick) as well as titer results (eg 1:20) and other results. The purpose of this check is to list all discrete results that are not aligned to the mapping (see last tab) and to ensure that they are mapped correct (if a mapping exists). If no mapping exists, the results should at least be upper case and make sense for the test in question."
23,Visual check,List out a distinct set of discrete test/result/nrc combination that have an LBNRIND of abnormal,"This is a visual based check and not an exception based check.

25,Error,Flag error if LBORNRLO = LBORNRHI when both are not null,"For tests yielding a discrete measure, when a reference range is present, the lower limit and upper limit in original results should be placed in LBORNRLO and LBORNRHI respectively. It is extremely unlikely that these two values are exactly the same. It is often the case that a reference range is 0. In this later case, this should be treated as a zero value reference range (See Lab Data Handling and Derivation document example 4) where the zero value is only placed in the upper limit of normal. If lower and upper limits have both been set to zero, then please correct as per example 4. If lower and upper limits match and both values are not zero, please investigate if the data are correct."

27,Visual check,Frequency table of NOT DONE with distinct reasons,"This is a visual based check and not an exception based check. For any records which are not done, the LBSTAT should be NOT DONE and a reason should be placed in the LBREASND. This check lists a distinct set of reasons why tests have not been performed. Please review each reason and make sure that the reasons looks valid. It is sometimes the case that values such as Too Numerous To Count or Below Quanitifiable Limits are placed in the reason not done field. Such values are results that belong in LBORRES/LBSTRESC, so if you see any reason text that actually a result, please address having them reported as results rather than reasons not done."
28,Visual check,Frequency table of LBNRIND,"This is a visual based check and not an exception based check. Tests can be split into two types&.those performed and reported multiple times over visits for all patients (eg Hemoglobin) and those which are performed but only reported when observed (eg atypical lypmohcytes). This visual check is aimed at the former (those tests where we expect multiple results for all subjects). For a normal population, we expect 95% of values to fall within range, and 5% to fall outside of range, but we also know that in many of our trials, the population is not ""normal"". For this check, it is recommended for the each test which is continuous, look at the percentage normal where this value is below 70%. Can this be explained by the disease area under study, or could this be due to a derivation error in LBNRIND. Investigate any such cases.  In addition, for continuous measures where LBNRIND is blank for all records, this may be due to a missing range. Have missing ranges been confirmed and documented with the lab. For discrete measures, if there is no range, there is no requirement to obtain the values considered normal to populate into LBSTNRC and these LBNRINDs can be left blank. Finally, when the number of observations is small, it is possible for percentages not to be truly representative. Please use common sense and check anything that seems unusual."
29,Error,"If the test is discrete and LBORRES is populated, LBORRESU should be null","For any unique combination (LBTESTCD, LBCAT, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD) in the LB domain yielding results as a discrete measure, no ORRESU should be provided. If the result is a discrete estimate from a dipstick, such as 30 mg/dL, then the unit should be concatenated into the LBORRES field. Please ensure that the requirement for an empty LBORRESU value for discrete measures in complied with."
30,Error,"If the record indicated Not Done, LBORRES, LBORRESU, LBORNRLO, LBORNRHI, LBSTRESC, LBSTRESN, LBSTRESU, LBSTNRC, LBNRIND should be null","For not done records, only a limited number of fields should be completed (reference Lab Data Handling and Derivation document example 9). This check lists records which are not compliant and which must be corrected"
31,Error,"For continuous record, derive LBNRIND based on ORRES values - check it matches LBNRIND provided in the dataset (use rules from document)","This check derives the LBNRIND for continuous measures ,according to the derivation rules detailed in the lab data handling and reference documentation, and compares it with the normal range indicator provided in the LB dataset, and lists out records where there is no match. Investigate non-matching values and ensure the correct derivation of LBNRIND in the LB domain. Please also note that for trials where there is an agreement that LBNRIND will not be derived in SDTM, or oncology trials where generic ranges are used and populated in the standard ranges values but not the original range values, differences will occur which do not require further investigation."
33,Visual check,List all distinct tests with no normal ranges (either original or standard) for continuous measure,"This is a visual based check and not an exception based check. For any unique combination (LBTESTCD, LBCAT, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD) in the LB domain yielding results as a continuous measure, a normal range is typically expected in either LBORNRLO and/or LBORNRHI. This check lists out all continuous tests that are missing ranges. There may be valid reasons (no reference range is expected for a viral load for Hepatitis for example, as it is not ""normal"" to have Hepatitis). For any test that one would expect to have normal ranges for, but where normal ranges are not provided, please ensure that the absence of ranges has been confirmed and documented"
34,Error,"For discrete tests, ensure LBORNRLO and LBORNRHI are both null","For any unique combination (LBTESTCD, LBCAT, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD) in the LB domain yielding results as a discrete measure, the standardized list of values considered normal (when available) is expected to be provided in LBSTNRC only. This check lists any discrete tests where LBORNRLO and/or LBORNRHI have been populated. Please ensure that the data are compliant with the rules and that such values are removed."
35,Error,"For discrete results, if LBSTNRC is provided, ensure LBNRIND has been derived correctly","For any unique combination (LBTESTCD, LBCAT, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD) in the LB domain yielding results as a discrete measure, LBNRIND is derived by comparing the standardized LBSTRESC with a list of standardized results considered normal and stored in LBSTNRC. This check performs the LBNRIND derivation for discrete results and compares the derived LBNRIND with the LBNRIND delivered in the LB domain, and displays records where there is a mismatch. Please check each mismatch and ensure that LBNRIND is derived correctly. This check supplements check 23 and 24 which is a visual check to make sure that derivations for discrete tests look logical and make sense."

Example included results such as Below Quantifiable Limits and Too Numerous to Count. This check lists all such textual results when reported for test where a continuous measure is expected.
